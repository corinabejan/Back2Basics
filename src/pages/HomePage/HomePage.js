        <h3>Who we are</h3>
        <p>
          Three human beings: Emnet, Darian and Corina. Three different
          countries: Ethiopia, South Africa and Romania. Three different
          cultures, and three different backgrounds. Three motivated people that
          experienced lack of education and gender equality first hand, and that
          hope they can make a change, even if it is a small one, any kind of
          change can make a big difference in the life of so many others. We are
          simply humans with a big desire to bring children around the world a
          chance to study and to find greatness. We humbly hope that our
          platform can do that.

        <h3>What we do</h3>
        <p>
          Back2Basics is a platform that is trying to facilitate studying for
          children, and bring awarness in gender equality. The basic idea behind
          this platform is to help narrow the gap in education and gender
          equality. We have set out to achieve this by setting out educational
          videos from Beginner to Advanced, with the option of making your own
          custom video as a teacher. It is a platform where children/adults can
          get great mentorship on how to help handle and improve their current
          challenges. We have gone with a more femine theme to appeal more to
          the female audience as we see this is the biggest gap to shrink.

        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>
          Back2Basics gives a chance to everyone to participate, wheter is a
          Teacher, a Student, a Mentor or a Men-Tee. Everyone can Sign Up for
          free on the platform on the specific role that they want to have. Each
          memmber has its own Dashboard that will include all the necessary
          information to interact with the platform. As a Teacher, you will be
          able to add a regular lesson or a custom one, everything being video
          based. As a Student you will have access to all available courses, you
          will be able to rewatch everything as many times as you want, and you
          also have a whiteboard where you can practice what you just learned.
          As a Mentor you will provide a description of yourself and see a list
          of people that are in need of a mentor, and as a Men-tee you will be
          able to see the profiles of the mentors and you can choose which
          mentor you believe is a good fit for your needs. It is simple to use,
          and very straightforward and in the future we also want to add a tech
          support line where we can answer all the questions that there are
          about how to navigate through the platform. Enjoy!!!!
